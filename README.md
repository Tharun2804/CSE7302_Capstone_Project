📖 Overview

Students in schools and colleges often struggle to stay engaged with environmental studies. Traditional methods of teaching about climate change, waste management, renewable energy, and biodiversity can be boring, unstructured, and hard to retain. Without interactive and practical learning, students may fail to develop sustainable habits.

The Gamified Environmental Education Platform transforms environmental learning into a fun, interactive, and action-oriented experience. By using games, quizzes, and challenges, the platform motivates students to actively participate while reinforcing eco-friendly practices.
